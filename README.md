## Features of the Project

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Utilized **Pandas** for data cleaning and manipulation.
   - Addressed missing or inconsistent data for accurate analysis.

2. **Statistical Analysis**:
   - Performed exploratory analysis using **NumPy** to calculate descriptive statistics like mean, median, and standard deviation.

3. **Data Visualization**:
   - Created meaningful visualizations using **Matplotlib** to identify trends and patterns over time.
   - Plotted line charts, bar graphs, and scatter plots for a comprehensive understanding of unemployment trends.

## Steps in the Project

1. **Dataset Loading**:
   Imported the dataset using Pandas and performed an initial exploration to understand its structure and content.

2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handled null values by filling them with appropriate statistical measures (e.g., mean).
   - Verified data consistency and removed outliers where necessary.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualized unemployment trends over the years using **line plots**.
   - Analyzed unemployment distribution with **histograms** and **box plots**.

4. **Insights and Trends**:
   - Observed the rise and fall of unemployment rates during economic downturns and growth periods.
   - Identified anomalies or unusual spikes in unemployment data.
